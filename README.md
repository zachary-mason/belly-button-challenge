Module 14 Challenge

In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

We used the D3 library to read the data and deployed an app through GitHub Pages displaying it.  The interactive dashboard contains a dropdown menu to select specific samples and visualizations of what was present via both a bar chart and bubble chart.
